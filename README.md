# **KF2 Server Tools**

WORK IN PROGRESS - CURRENTLY NOT FUNCTIONAL

## Purpose

Adding maps to a Killing Floor 2 Dedicated server requires subscribing to the workshop item on Steam and making various edits to configuration files. This will automate the process so that once you subscribe to some maps on steam you will only need to run this to perform all configuration necessary.

## Planned Additions
1. CMD Helper - Provide easy access to various commands and class names. Make it so any idiot can easily use whatever kind of command they want.
